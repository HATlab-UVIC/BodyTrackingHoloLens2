# Python Server and Client for OpenPose

These scripts need to be in this folder otherwise they won't work correctly:

C:\Users\hatla\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\openpose\build\examples\tutorial_api_python

run the following command in command line to start the TCP Server ( don't use the visual studio code python extension it won't work!)
```  
python TCPServer.py
```
