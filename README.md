# Body Tracking with HoloLens 2

This app does body tracking using the cameras on a HoloLens 2 and with OpenPose.

The binaries for the depth camera stream and the video camera stream were taken from:

[EnoxSoftware/HoloLensCameraStream: This Unity plugin makes the HoloLens video camera frames available to a Unity app in real time. This enables Unity devs to easily use the HoloLens1/HoloLens2 camera for computer vision (or anything they want). (github.com)](https://github.com/EnoxSoftware/HoloLensCameraStream)

Also special thanks to this article for its help starting the application:
